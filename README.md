### Setting up your database 
*  Install MySQL Server (if you haven't already)
* Connect to MySQL Server - <br />
Use a MySQL client or command-line tool to connect. <br /> 

      For example: mysql -u[YOUR-USERNAME] -p[YOUR-PASSWORD];

* Create a new database - <br />

      CREATE DATABASE [yourdbname];
    Replace yourdbname with your preferred database name.

* Creating Tables in a Database - <br />
Next create a table in our database

      CREATE TABLE Stylists (Name VARCHAR (255), PhoneNumber string, HireDate DATETIME);
    This creates a table called Stylist with columns for name, phone number, and hire. Each column name has a datatype appended to it. Create one for Clients as well.

### Installation

* once is clone create your .gitignore file by running `touch .gitignore`. Add bin and obj to your file.

* Create your `appsettings.json` file within the projects production directory to protect the sensitive data within our database connection string by adding it to our `.gitignore`

* Add your appsettings.json with the following contents, replacing the following values with your own:

      [YOUR-USER-HERE] with your username

        }
      }
* In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
